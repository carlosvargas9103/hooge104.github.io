I am a senior scientist at the [Crowther Lab](https://www.crowtherlab.com/). I help colleagues with global mapping projects, collect and process data, write papers, run the lab and make sure the coffee machine is working. 

I graduated from [Wageningen University](http://www.sph.umn.edu/academics/divisions/biostatistics/) with a MS in biotechnology in 2012, specializing in molecular biolgy. In 2018 I finished my PhD cellular signaling in the potato late blight pathogen <i>Phytophthora infestans</i> in 2018.
