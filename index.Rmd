I am a research scientist at the [Crowther Lab](https://www.crowtherlab.com/). Working on the intersection of ecology, global change and data science, I create global high-resolution maps that help shape the fundamental understanding of planet Earth. This knowledge can help to make the right decisions in the fight against climate change.
