After graduating from Wageningen University (Netherlands) with a MSc. in Biotechnolgy, I continued in the molecular biology field with my PhD in the Laboratory of Phytopathology in the group of Prof. Francine Govers. Here, I studied the role and functioning of cell surface receptor proteins in the potato late blight pathogen Phytophthora infestans. These proteins, so-called G-protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs), are essential deducting extracellular sensing to intracellular signaling pathways. A classroom example of GPCRs are olfactory receptors; humans have abouth 1,000 of such proteins encoded on their genome. In Phytophthora, I discoverd, there is a whole new realm of GPCRs, with N- and C-terminal functional domains. Then, using extensive genomic exploration, I discoverd that these unique proteins are in fact quite widespread; they are shared among several diverse protistan species. Currently, the hypothesis is that these proteins existed in the earliest eukaryotes and that they were lost several times during evolution of 'higher order' eukaryotes. https://mbio.asm.org/content/9/1/e02119-17, https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1007064

Currently, I am a senior scientiest in the <a href="http://crowtherlab.com/">Crowther Lab</a> at ETH ZÃ¼rich. Here
