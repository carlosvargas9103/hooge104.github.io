# Datasets overview
This page lists datasets that we have currently available, either stored locally, on `Google Earth Engine`, or remotely. 

# Google Earth Engine composite
Managed by T3, we have a stack of environmental rasters stored on GEE, colloquially referred to as 'the composite'. Currently there are 440 terrestrial layers in this stack. In addition, an ocean version is available too, with ~200 layers. All details are found in [this document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/3/d/11ONkvaSJ0iFoh7JhHiylSWvV5DPUkqguYjJEGMCDBAM/edit#gid=0).
